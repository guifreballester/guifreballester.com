## TL;DR

Built a new product line targeting AI agent developers and LLM builders. 40 customers (19.8% of total) drove 50% of new revenue, achieving $10K MRR in 2 months and landing $30K ARR accounts.

## Context

The SEO market was evolving toward AI agents and LLMs. Rather than repositioning the existing API, I saw an opportunity to create an entirely new product line serving this emerging segment.

## Problem

- Traditional SEO tools weren't built for AI/LLM use cases
- AI developers needed different data formats and access patterns
- No product specifically targeting AI agent builders
- Needed to capture the growing LLM market before competitors

## What I Did

1. **Market Analysis**: Identified the AI agent/LLM builder segment as underserved
2. **Product Design**: Built for scale with 250 RPS per account to handle AI workloads
3. **Positioning**: Created distinct product positioning for AI developers vs traditional SEO users
4. **Enterprise Sales**: Positioned for enterprise with dedicated support and higher-tier pricing

## Key Decisions

### New Product Line, Not a Pivot
Instead of repositioning the existing API, created a separate product line. This allowed for different pricing, positioning, and feature priorities.

### Scale-First Architecture
Designed for 250 RPS per account from day one, anticipating AI agent workloads that process data at scale.

### Enterprise-Ready
Positioned for enterprise with dedicated support tiers, enabling $30K ARR accounts.

## Technical Details

- **High-Throughput Design**: 250 RPS per account with burst handling
- **AI-Optimized Responses**: Structured data formats optimized for LLM consumption
- **Batch Processing**: Bulk endpoints for processing multiple queries efficiently
- **Webhook Callbacks**: Async processing for large-scale data retrieval

## Results

<div className="grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 my-8">
  <MetricCard value="40" label="Customers (19.8% of total)" />
  <MetricCard value="50%" label="Of New Revenue" />
  <MetricCard value="$10K" label="MRR in 2 Months" />
  <MetricCard value="$30K" label="ARR Accounts Landed" />
  <MetricCard value="250" label="RPS per Account" />
</div>

## Lessons Learned

1. **New markets need new products**: Trying to serve AI developers with an SEO-focused product wouldn't have worked. Separate positioning was key.
2. **Scale is a feature**: AI developers evaluate APIs differently—throughput and reliability matter more than feature count.
3. **Enterprise pays for value**: Higher pricing attracted better customers who valued dedicated support.
