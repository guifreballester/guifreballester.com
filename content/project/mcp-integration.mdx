## TL;DR

First to ship Model Context Protocol (MCP) in the SEO/search space. Iterated from local/subscription (poor retention) to remote/pay-as-you-go (signups skyrocketed). Now accounts for 30% of company signups—SEO professionals querying data via ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

## Context

AI agents needed easy ways to access SEO data. Model Context Protocol (MCP) was emerging as the standard for connecting AI assistants to external data sources. Being first to market could capture a new segment.

## Problem

- AI agents couldn't easily access SEO data
- Technical barrier was high for non-developers
- Traditional API required coding knowledge
- SEO professionals wanted natural language access to data

## What I Did

### V1: Local Setup + Subscription
- Shipped MCP integration running locally
- Required technical setup (Node.js, configuration files)
- Subscription-based pricing model

**Result**: Poor retention. Setup was too technical, and subscription created friction for occasional users.

### V2: Remote + Pay-as-You-Go
- Pivoted to remote-hosted MCP server
- Pay-as-you-go pricing (no subscription required)
- One-click setup in Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini

**Result**: Signups skyrocketed.

## Key Decisions

### Bet Early on Emerging Protocol
Committed to MCP before it was widely adopted. Being first established us as the go-to SEO data source for AI assistants.

### Remove Friction at Every Step
V1 failed because of friction. V2 succeeded by eliminating setup complexity and subscription commitment.

### Target Non-Developers
Realized the market wasn't AI developers (who use the API directly) but SEO professionals who wanted natural language access.

## Technical Details

- **MCP Server**: Remote-hosted server handling authentication and rate limiting
- **Pay-as-You-Go Metering**: Usage-based billing integrated with existing payment infrastructure
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Compatible with Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini
- **Natural Language Interface**: Optimized prompts and responses for conversational queries

- Opened AI agent and no-code markets (n8n, Make.com)
- Created new acquisition channel independent of traditional marketing

## Lessons Learned

1. **Iteration beats perfection**: V1 failed, but fast iteration to V2 captured the market. Shipping early let us learn.
2. **Friction kills products**: The difference between V1 and V2 was entirely about reducing friction—same core technology.
3. **First-mover advantage is real**: Being first to ship MCP in our space established us as the default choice.
4. **Find the real user**: We thought we were building for developers but found product-market fit with SEO professionals.
