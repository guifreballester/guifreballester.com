## TL;DR

Led the architectural shift from monorepo to polyrepo at Eventbrite. Scaled adoption from 2 to 40 teams (90% adoption), enabling independent deployments and team autonomy.

## Context

Eventbrite's monorepo architecture was becoming a liability. Teams couldn't move independently—merge conflicts were constant, deployments were coupled, and a bug in one team's code could block everyone.

## Problem

- Monorepo was slowing teams down
- Constant merge conflicts between teams
- Coupled deployments—one team's issue blocked all deploys
- Teams couldn't own their deployment cadence
- Only 2 teams had migrated after months of effort

## What I Did

1. **Assessment**: Mapped dependencies and identified migration candidates
2. **Coalition Building**: Built buy-in across engineering leadership for the architectural shift
3. **Migration Path**: Designed incremental migration that didn't disrupt active development
4. **Governance Model**: Created standardized templates and policies for polyrepo teams

## Key Decisions

### Governance Through Templates
Instead of centralized control, encoded governance into templates. Teams get autonomy within guardrails.

### Incremental Migration
No big-bang migration. Teams migrated when ready, with support from the platform team.

### Clear Ownership Model
Each repo has a single owning team with full deployment authority.

## Technical Details

- **Polyrepo Governance**: Automated compliance checks, dependency management, and security policies
- **Template Standardization**: Consistent CI/CD, testing, and deployment patterns across all repos
- **Dependency Management**: Automated dependency updates and security patching
- **Migration Tooling**: Scripts and guides for teams migrating from monorepo

## Results

<div className="grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 my-8">
  <MetricCard value="2 → 40" label="Teams Migrated" />
  <MetricCard value="90%" label="Adoption Rate" />
  <MetricCard value="Independent" label="Deployments Enabled" />
</div>

- Teams deploy independently without coordinating with other teams
- Merge conflicts between teams eliminated
- Each team owns their deployment cadence

## Lessons Learned

1. **Migration requires coalition**: Architectural changes need buy-in from leadership and clear communication to affected teams.
2. **Autonomy with guardrails**: Teams want freedom; platform teams need consistency. Templates bridge the gap.
3. **Don't force migration**: Let early adopters prove value. Success stories drive organic adoption.
4. **Ownership clarity matters**: Clear ownership model eliminated "whose bug is this?" debates.
