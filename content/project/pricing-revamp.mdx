## TL;DR

Raised base price 50% ($99 → $149), added enterprise tiers with 100-300M credits, and redesigned packaging. Result: 100+ logos in 6 months with sustainable unit economics.

## Context

Initial API pricing at $99 was too cheap. It resulted in low MRR, attracted price-sensitive customers who churned quickly, and didn't signal enterprise-grade quality.

## Problem

- $99 price point attracting wrong customer segment
- Low MRR despite decent customer count
- No clear path from self-service to enterprise
- Price didn't reflect product value
- Enterprise customers had no appropriate tier

## What I Did

1. **Customer Analysis**: Segmented existing customers by usage, retention, and willingness to pay
2. **Competitive Analysis**: Benchmarked pricing against comparable API products
3. **Value Metric Design**: Defined credit-based pricing that aligned with customer value
4. **Tier Architecture**: Designed tiers that created natural upgrade paths

## Key Decisions

### 50% Price Increase
Raised base price from $99 to $149. Counterintuitively, this improved conversion by signaling quality.

### Credit-Based Tiers
Moved from feature-based to usage-based pricing with clear credit allocations:
- Base tier: Standard credits
- Mid tier: Higher credits + priority support
- Enterprise: 100-300M credits + dedicated support

### Enterprise Path
Created clear upgrade path from self-service to enterprise, with dedicated account management for high-value customers.

## Pricing Structure

| Tier | Price | Credits | Support |
|------|-------|---------|---------|
| Starter | $149/mo | Standard | Email |
| Growth | $299/mo | 2x | Priority |
| Enterprise | Custom | 100-300M | Dedicated |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Price signals value**: Too-low pricing hurt us. Raising prices attracted better customers.
2. **Align price with value**: Credit-based pricing meant customers paid for what they used.
3. **Create upgrade paths**: Enterprise tier captured customers who outgrew self-service.
4. **Don't fear price increases**: Existing customers accepted the increase; new customers never knew the old price.
