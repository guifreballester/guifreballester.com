## TL;DR

Built a self-service automation platform that reduced repository creation from 2 weeks to 30 minutes—a 99% reduction. Now serving 150 engineers across the organization.

## Context

Eventbrite's engineering teams were blocked by slow infrastructure provisioning. Creating a new repository required manual approvals, DevOps involvement, and navigating scattered documentation. Engineers were waiting weeks to start new projects.

## Problem

- Repository creation took **2 weeks** due to manual approvals and bottlenecks
- DevOps team was overwhelmed with manual requests
- No self-service infrastructure—every request required DevOps intervention
- Documentation was scattered and outdated
- Engineers couldn't start new projects without waiting in queue

## What I Did

1. **Process Mapping**: Documented the entire repo creation workflow to identify bottlenecks
2. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Built consensus with DevOps, Security, and Engineering leadership
3. **Platform Design**: Designed self-service automation with guardrails
4. **Incremental Rollout**: Piloted with friendly teams before org-wide launch

## Key Decisions

### Self-Service with Guardrails
Instead of removing approvals, automated the approval criteria. Security and compliance checks happen automatically, blocking only genuine issues.

### Template-Based Creation
Standardized templates for common service types (API, worker, frontend) with best practices baked in.

### Integrated CI/CD
New repos come with GitHub Actions workflows, security scanning, and deployment pipelines pre-configured.

## Technical Details

- **Automation Platform**: Internal tool built on GitHub Actions and Terraform
- **Template Library**: Standardized templates for APIs, workers, and frontend services
- **Security Scanning**: Automated SAST/DAST integration from day one
- **IaC Templates**: Terraform modules for databases, caches, and queues

## Results

</div>

- Eliminated DevOps bottleneck for repo provisioning
- Engineers can start new projects same-day
- Consistent security and compliance from day one

## Lessons Learned

1. **Automate the approval, not just the task**: The bottleneck wasn't the work—it was waiting for approvals. Automating approval criteria was key.
2. **Templates encode best practices**: Good defaults mean teams start with security, monitoring, and CI/CD without thinking about it.
3. **Self-service is a force multiplier**: Every hour invested in self-service tooling saves hundreds of engineering hours.
