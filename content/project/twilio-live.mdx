## TL;DR

Identified a gap competitors missed in the post-COVID video market. Built Twilio Live from 0→1, driving $200K MRR with 100+ customers and 35% enterprise growth.

## Context

Post-COVID, everyone needed video. But competitors focused on meetings and conferencing—Zoom, Teams, Google Meet. I identified an unserved need: streaming at scale for broadcasts, events, and one-to-many use cases.

## Problem

- Competitors focused on meetings (many-to-many), not streaming (one-to-many)
- Enterprises needed to broadcast to thousands, not host meetings
- Existing solutions required stitching together multiple tools
- No developer-friendly streaming API existed

## What I Did

1. **Customer Discovery**: Conducted extensive interviews to validate the streaming gap
2. **Business Case**: Built ROI models for new product investment
3. **Product Development**: Owned feature prioritization and roadmap
4. **Sales Enablement**: Created technical sales materials and trained the team

## Key Decisions

### Find Gaps, Not Competition
Instead of competing head-to-head on meetings, found the underserved streaming market.

### Customer-Validated Features
Every feature started with customer validation. Built features that customers committed to paying for before development.

### Enterprise Focus
Concentrated on enterprise segment where Twilio had competitive advantages (reliability, compliance, scale).

### API-First Design
Maintained Twilio's API-first philosophy, ensuring Twilio Live integrated seamlessly with other Twilio products.

## Technical Details

- **WebRTC Architecture**: Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) for scalable video
- **Video Streaming**: Low-latency HLS for broadcasting to thousands
- **SDK Design**: Native SDKs for iOS, Android, JavaScript with consistent APIs
- **API Documentation**: Interactive API explorer and comprehensive guides

## Lessons Learned

1. **Look for gaps, not competition**: Instead of competing head-to-head, find underserved markets.
2. **Customer validation de-risks features**: Features built with customer commitment had much higher adoption.
3. **Enterprise sales needs PM support**: Technical content and training directly impacted deal velocity.
4. **API consistency matters**: Developers expect products to work together seamlessly. Design for the ecosystem.
