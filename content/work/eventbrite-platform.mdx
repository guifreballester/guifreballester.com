## TL;DR

Led platform engineering initiatives that reduced repository creation from 2 weeks to 30 minutes and cut infrastructure provisioning from 1 week to minutes. Built AI-powered documentation system that reduced internal support burden by 63%.

## Context

Eventbrite's engineering teams were blocked by slow infrastructure provisioning and deployment bottlenecks. The monorepo architecture was becoming a liability—teams couldn't move independently, and DevOps was overwhelmed with manual requests.

## Problem

- Repository creation took **2 weeks** due to manual approvals and bottlenecks
- DevOps could only handle ~1 deployment per week
- Monorepo was slowing teams down and creating merge conflicts
- No self-service infrastructure—every request required DevOps intervention
- Documentation was scattered and outdated, creating constant support burden

## My Role & Approach

As Senior PM for Platform Engineering, I led the transformation of developer experience:

1. **Assessment**: Mapped the entire developer journey to identify bottlenecks
2. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Built coalition across engineering leadership for polyrepo migration
3. **Incremental Delivery**: Designed migration path that didn't disrupt active development
4. **Metrics-Driven**: Established clear KPIs for developer productivity

## Key Decisions

### Polyrepo Migration
Led the architectural shift from monorepo to polyrepo, giving teams autonomy while maintaining governance through standardized templates.

### Self-Service Infrastructure Platform
Built a 0-to-1 developer automation platform enabling teams to provision infrastructure without DevOps involvement.

### AI-Powered Documentation
Deployed RAG-based documentation system to surface relevant information and reduce repetitive questions to platform teams.

### AWS Cloud Modernization
Partnered with engineering on cloud modernization, improving performance and reducing costs.

## Technical Details

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Standardized GitHub Actions workflows with security scanning
- **Polyrepo Governance**: Automated compliance checks, dependency management, and security policies
- **IaC Templates**: Terraform modules for common infrastructure patterns (databases, caches, queues)
- **AI Documentation**: RAG system built on internal knowledge base with Slack integration

## Lessons Learned

1. **Platform as a product**: Internal platforms need the same product rigor as customer-facing products. User research, metrics, and iteration apply equally.
2. **Self-service is a force multiplier**: Every hour invested in self-service tooling saves hundreds of engineering hours.
3. **AI documentation works**: RAG-based systems dramatically reduce support burden when tuned properly.
4. **Migration requires coalition**: Architectural changes need buy-in from leadership and clear communication to affected teams.
