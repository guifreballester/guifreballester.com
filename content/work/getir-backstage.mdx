## TL;DR

Drove 0-to-1 implementation of Backstage Internal Developer Portal and led GitOps migration, reducing deployment time from hours to 5 minutes and improving deployment efficiency by 60%.

## Context

Getir was rapidly scaling as an ultrafast delivery startup. Engineering teams across multiple countries needed standardized infrastructure and developer experience. The existing manual processes couldn't keep pace with growth.

## Problem

- Manual infrastructure requests creating bottlenecks
- Inconsistent security configurations across teams
- Slow deployments taking hours
- No visibility into services and their dependencies
- Each team solving the same infrastructure problems independently

## My Role & Approach

As Technical Product Manager, I led the platform engineering initiatives:

1. **Discovery**: Interviewed engineering teams across geographies to understand pain points
2. **Tool Selection**: Evaluated IDP options (Backstage, Port, Cortex) against Getir's requirements
3. **Roadmap**: Defined phased rollout starting with service catalog, then templates, then automation
4. **Change Management**: Created adoption strategy and training programs

## Key Decisions

### Backstage as IDP
Selected Backstage for its extensibility and strong community. Built custom plugins for Getir-specific workflows.

### GitOps-First Infrastructure
Led migration to GitOps with ArgoCD, enabling declarative infrastructure and automatic drift detection.

### Self-Service Templates
Created golden path templates for common service patterns, encoding security best practices by default.

### Standardized Security
Implemented security configurations as code, ensuring consistent policies across all services.

## Technical Details

- **Backstage Architecture**: Kubernetes-deployed Backstage with custom plugins for deployment, monitoring, and cost
- **GitOps Workflows**: ArgoCD for application deployment, Flux for infrastructure
- **Terraform Modules**: Reusable modules for AWS and GCP resources
- **Service Catalog**: Automated discovery and documentation of 200+ microservices

## Outcomes

<div className="grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 my-8">
  <MetricCard value="5 min" label="Deployment Time (from hours)" />
  <MetricCard value="60%" label="Deployment Efficiency Gain" />
  <MetricCard value="Improved" label="Security Posture" />
  <MetricCard value="200+" label="Services Cataloged" />
</div>

- Reduced security configuration errors significantly
- Improved audit trails and compliance posture
- Created single source of truth for service ownership and dependencies

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with the catalog**: Before automation, teams need visibility. Service catalog was the foundation for everything else.
2. **Golden paths, not golden cages**: Templates should accelerate, not constrain. Allow teams to eject when needed.
3. **GitOps requires culture change**: Technical implementation is easy; changing how teams think about deployments takes time.
4. **Platform adoption is gradual**: Forced migrations fail. Let early adopters prove value, then others follow.
