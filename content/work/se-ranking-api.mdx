## TL;DR

Launched enterprise API products from scratch, targeting AI Search and LLM/agent use cases. Achieved 34% quarter-over-quarter business growth by expanding from SEO tools to the AI/automation segment.

## Context

SE Ranking had built massive web crawling infrastructure to power their SEO tools. The opportunity emerged to monetize this infrastructure and expand beyond traditional SEO into AI-powered data products—a rapidly growing market with demand from LLM developers and AI agents.

## Problem

- No existing API product offering
- Unclear market positioning in the competitive AI Search space
- Needed to establish product-market fit quickly
- Complex technical infrastructure that wasn't designed for external API access

## My Role & Approach

As the first API Product Manager, I owned the entire product lifecycle from discovery to launch:

1. **Market Research**: Analyzed AI Search competitors and identified gaps in the market for real-time web data APIs
2. **Customer Development**: Conducted 30+ interviews with potential customers (AI startups, automation platforms, enterprise teams)
3. **Product Strategy**: Defined the API product roadmap prioritizing time-to-first-integration as the key metric
4. **Technical Partnership**: Collaborated closely with engineering to design API architecture for scale

## Key Decisions

### Self-Service First
Prioritized self-service trials over enterprise sales motions. This reduced time-to-value and let the product speak for itself.

### MCP Integration
Early bet on Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI agent compatibility. This positioned us ahead of competitors in the emerging agent ecosystem.

### No-Code Integrations
Built n8n and Make.com integrations to capture the no-code automation segment, expanding TAM beyond developers.

### Minimal Time-to-First-Integration
Every product decision was evaluated against this metric. Resulted in streamlined onboarding and comprehensive quickstart guides.

## Technical Details

- **API Architecture**: RESTful APIs with rate limiting, API key authentication, and webhook callbacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithm with tiered limits based on plan
- **Authentication**: API key-based with optional OAuth 2.0 for enterprise
- **Webhook Design**: Real-time notifications for async crawling results
- **Integration Patterns**: SDKs in Python, Node.js, and REST examples

## Lessons Learned

1. **Developer experience is the product**: For API products, DX determines adoption. Invested heavily in documentation and quickstart guides.
2. **Bet on emerging platforms early**: MCP integration paid off as AI agents gained traction.
3. **Self-service accelerates learning**: Usage data from self-service trials provided faster feedback than enterprise pilots.
