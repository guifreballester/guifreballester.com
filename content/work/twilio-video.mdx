## TL;DR

Built zero-to-one video features and supported go-to-market for Twilio's video products, driving MRR to $200K and acquiring 100+ monthly active customers.

## Context

Twilio needed to expand its video product capabilities to compete in the growing real-time communication market. The company was launching Twilio Live for streaming use cases and needed to strengthen the core Video product for enterprise customers.

## Problem

- Building 0-to-1 video features in a competitive market with established players
- Needed to drive adoption and prove commercial viability
- Enterprise customers required features not yet built
- Technical sales team needed better materials and training

## My Role & Approach

As Product Manager for Video, I owned feature development and go-to-market:

1. **Customer Discovery**: Conducted extensive interviews with enterprise prospects to understand requirements
2. **Feature Prioritization**: Built business cases for features based on revenue potential
3. **Technical Partnership**: Worked closely with engineering on WebRTC optimizations
4. **Sales Enablement**: Created technical content and trained sales teams

## Key Decisions

### Customer-Validated Features
Every feature started with customer validation. Built features that customers committed to paying for before development.

### Enterprise Focus
Concentrated on enterprise segment where Twilio had competitive advantages (reliability, compliance, scale).

### Technical Sales Investment
Created comprehensive technical sales materials and conducted training programs for the sales team.

### API-First Design
Maintained Twilio's API-first philosophy, ensuring video features integrated seamlessly with other Twilio products.

## Technical Details

- **WebRTC Architecture**: Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) for scalable video conferencing
- **Video Streaming**: Low-latency HLS for Twilio Live broadcasting
- **SDK Design**: Native SDKs for iOS, Android, JavaScript with consistent APIs
- **API Documentation**: Interactive API explorer and comprehensive guides

## Lessons Learned

1. **Customer validation de-risks features**: Features built with customer commitment had much higher adoption rates.
2. **Enterprise sales needs PM support**: Technical content and training directly impacted deal velocity.
3. **API consistency matters**: Developers expect Twilio products to work together seamlessly. Design for the ecosystem.
4. **Video is table stakes for communication**: The pandemic accelerated video adoption, making it essential rather than optional.
